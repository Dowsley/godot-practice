# Personal Godot Practice
Developing my game-making skills little by little.

## Pong
My first game. A simple, but important start. The rule was any non-pong-specific learning material was allowed.

## Topdown Shooter
Mostly ~~copied~~ learned from this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/HycyFNQfqI0). It was a good (and fun) framework to build/learn upon.
