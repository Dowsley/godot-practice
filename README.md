# Personal Godot Practice
Developing my game-making skills little by little.

## Pong
My first game. A simple, but important start. The rule was any non-pong-specific learning material was allowed.

## Topdown Shooter
Mostly ~~copied~~ learned from this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/HycyFNQfqI0). It was a good (and fun) framework to build/learn upon.

## Falling Sand
I got fascinated by Noita's complex sandbox system and tried a low-level approach to make my own little sandbox.

## Procedural Universe
I always liked the concept of procedurally infinite worlds, and I also wanted to learn custom drawing in Godot... and I also love astronomy... and elite dangerous. All in all that's the result and I am proud of it.
